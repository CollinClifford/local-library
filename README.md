A school project that I worked on the displays my understand for JavaScript functions.

Within the /public/src/ files you can see I demonstrate my grasp on:
* Advanced JavaScript Functions.
* the use of Helper Functions.
* the ability to write clean lines of code.
* keeping code clean and concise through the use of comments.
